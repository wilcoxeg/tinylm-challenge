<div class="paragraph"> <b> Summary: </b> This shared task challenges community members to train a language model on the amount of linguistic experience available to a human learner.

<div class="title"> Overview </div>

<div class="paragraph"> Huge effort has been put into optimizing LM pretraining at massive scales in the last several years. While growing parameter counts often get the most attention, datasets have also grown by orders of magnitude. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556v1"> Chinchilla </a> sees about 14,000 times the amount of input as a 10 year old human. </div>

<div class="paragraph"> The goal of this shared task will be to incentivize researchers with an interest in pretraining or cognitive modeling to focus their efforts on optimizing pretraining given data limitations inspired by human development. Additionally, we hope to democratize research on pretraining—which is typically thought to be practical only for large industry groups—by drawing attention to open problems that can be addressed on a university budget. </div>




<div class="title" > Why <100 Million Words? </div>

<div class="paragraph"> Focusing on scaled down pretraining has several potential benefits: First, small scale pretraining can be a sandbox for developing novel techniques for improving data efficiency. These techniques have the potential to then scale up to larger scales commonly seen in applied NLP or used to enhance current approaches to modeling low-resource languages. Second, improving our ability to train LMs on the same kinds and quantities of data that humans learn from hopefully will give us greater access to plausible cognitive models of humans and help us understand what allows humans to acquire language so efficiently. </div>
